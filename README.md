# Student-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard

## Overview :

This project analyzes various factors influencing high school students' academic performance. By utilizing data visualization with D3.js, we aim to uncover the relationships between health, family dynamics, and exam outcomes. The goal is to provide an interactive and intuitive exploration of how these factors impact students' educational achievements.

## Methodology :

Our approach involves a thorough examination of several key variables:

- **Health Indicators:** Assessing the influence of physical and mental well-being on academic results.
- **Family Dynamics:** Understanding how familial circumstances, such as parental involvement and support systems, affect student outcomes.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through EDA, we identify patterns, trends, and outliers, providing deeper insights into the connections between student well-being and academic performance.

## TechStack Used :

- **D3.js**: The primary tool for building dynamic, interactive visualizations, allowing users to explore the data and its findings intuitively.
- **Python**: Employed for data preprocessing, cleaning, and preparing the dataset for visualization.
